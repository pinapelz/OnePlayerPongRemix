# OnePlayerPongRemix
Classic styled pong but its built for one player with no AI. The game uses all 4 directional arrows and two new paddles are added (top and bottom) for score multipliers. 
Written entirely in Lua using the Love2D Engine. The code is based on Pong from the Harvard GD50 Course.

## How to build from source?
1. Download and install the Love2D engine for your OS
2. Download all files from this repo and make them into a .zip file
3. Change the extension of the file to .love (replace .zip with .love)

Alternatively you may download the executables under releases (only if on Windows) or the pre-configured .love file (Linux and Mac OS)

### In order to play after launching you must press enter twice
